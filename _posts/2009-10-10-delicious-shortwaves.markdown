title: Delicious Shortwaves
excerpt: Using Delicious keywords with Shortwave.
---

Delicious has a feature I like. Whenever you bookmark something, you have the option of assigning a keyword, similar to the Firefox [Smart Keywords](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Smart+keywords "Smart keywords") feature. The advantage the Delicious implementation has over this, is that it is easy to synchronize across multiple computers by installing the [Delicious Bookmarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615) plugin. 

For example if I wanted to assign a shortcut for Google, I would bookmark the url http://www.google.com/search?&q=<abbr title="this is the placeholder for the search term">%s</abbr>, and assign the letter g. In this instance I could go the the location bar, type `g peanut` and I would be taken to the search results page for that excellent nut.

The problem is I prefer Safari to Firefox which means I can&rsquo;t use any of this in my favorite browser. Luckily
