## About Ben

I’m a web developer in San Francisco. I’m passionate about building websites, programming and tools-obsessed. I build [Feedbin][f], a simple, good-looking online RSS reader. I work at [Flickerbox, Inc.][fb]

Did I mention I’m obsessed with tools? [TextMate][tm] is the my favorite and I use it for just about everything I work on. This site is published using [Jekyll][jk] which “…is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.” The [source for the site][src] and the site itself is hosted on GitHub.
