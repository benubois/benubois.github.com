I’m a web developer in San Francisco. I’m passionate about building websites, programming and tools-obsessed.

Did I mention I’m obsessed with tools? [TextMate][tm] is the my favorite and I use it for just about everything I work on. This site is published using [Jekyll][jk] which “…is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.” The [source for the site][src] and the site itself is hosted on GitHub. Some of my other favorites include: [Simplenote][sn], a great notes application for the iPhone, and [Reeder][reeder], where I faithfully (try to) keep up with the ~232 feeds I subscribe to.
